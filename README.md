NFT Mura (NFT Village) is planned to be an analytics platform centered around the OPENSEA API. This will be written in TypeScript, React, NodeJS, Google Firebase, firestore. The intention of this project is to allow viewers to see trends and patterns on a desired collection of their choosing. Users can search by collection or bu individual assets and utilizing front end graphing packages, they will be able to see trends for various stats including trends of price over time of specific traits of a specific collection for example. This will be a publicly hosted website and the requirement for this website and API usage will have to be quite high in terms of calls per minute. We will utilize caching to minimize the need for repeated calls for the same collection within a given time period but regardless, each collection and pulling info about each asset within a collection may be quite a large number of calls required within a short amount of time. For example, within a day, we can have someone pull a collection's info, timestamp it and that is what other uses will see from the cache for X hours in the day until a certain next time period when we update the information and so on and so forth.
